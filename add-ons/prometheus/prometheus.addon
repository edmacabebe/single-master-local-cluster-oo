# Name: prometheus
# Description: This template creates a Prometheus instance preconfigured to gather OpenShift and
# Kubernetes platform and node metrics and report them to admins. It is protected by an
# OAuth proxy that only allows access for users who have view access to the prometheus
# namespace. You may customize where the images (built from openshift/prometheus
# and openshift/oauth-proxy) are pulled from via template parameters.
